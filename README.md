We argue both AI and Java by their nature are complex.
Thus, we put forward two hypotheses as  antidotes:
1. Practice.   
2. [Crawl before you walk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crawl_before_one_walks).

This project is an original introduction to AI using Java following these theories of education.
The main emphasis is on learning algorithms for
artificial neural networks (ANNs) using [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/) .
